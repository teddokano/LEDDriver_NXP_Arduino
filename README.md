# 0. LEDDriver_NXP_Arduino
LED driver device operation sample code for [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) 

> **Note**
This library works with [`I2C_device`](https://github.com/teddokano/I2C_device_Arduino) library together. Please be sure the `I2C_device` library is imported in your environment before trying to build. 

> **Warning**  
**Default setting of LED brightness may be too strong!**  
Basic sample code have setting of mamximum current output. It may be too bright for normal use.  
If you want to turn down the output, adjust first parameter of `ledd.begin(1.0, PCA9955B::ARDUINO_SHIELD);` method call.  
The first `1.0` means the ratio of all output current. The 1.0 is for 100% (maximum output). So it could be **0.1** or so for softer brightness.  

```cpp
// Changing output current setting
void setup() {
  ...
  ..
  Wire.begin();
  //ledd.begin( 1.0, PCA9955B::ARDUINO_SHIELD ); // <-- This was original 
  ledd.begin( 0.1, PCA9955B::ARDUINO_SHIELD );   // <-- Current setting is changed to 0.1 (means 10% of max)
}

```

## 0.3 Code sample
With `LEDDriver_NXP_Arduino` library, the LEDs can be managed simple API.  
For PCA9955B and PCA9956B, those operations are quite similar. When the device is changed, just overwrite class name from `PCA9955B` to `PCA9956B`.  

```cpp
// Very simple sample to use the 'PCA9955BTW-ARD LED Driver Arduino® Shield Evaluation Board'

#include <PCA9955B.h>

PCA9955B ledd;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("\n***** Hello, PCA9955B! *****");

  Wire.begin();
  ledd.begin(1.0, PCA9955B::ARDUINO_SHIELD);
}

void loop() {
  ledd.pwm(0, 1.0);
  Serial.println("ON ");
  delay(100);

  ledd.pwm(0, 0.0);
  Serial.println("OFF");
  delay(100);
}
```

For PCA9957, it uses an SPI as serial interface. To use the SPI, need to have `SPI.begin()` in `setup()` function. 

```cpp
// Very simple sample to use the 'PCA9957HN-ARD LED Driver Arduino® Shield Evaluation Board'

#include <PCA9957.h>

PCA9957 ledd;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial)
    ;

  SPI.begin();
  pinMode(SS, OUTPUT);  //  Required for UNO R4
  
  ledd.begin(1.0, PCA9957::ARDUINO_SHIELD);

  Serial.println("\n***** Hello, PCA9957! *****");
}

void loop() {
  ledd.pwm(0, 1.0);
  Serial.println("ON ");
  delay(100);

  ledd.pwm(0, 0.0);
  Serial.println("OFF");
  delay(100);
}
```

## 2.2 LED driver library
`PCA9955B`, `PCA9956B` and `PCA9957` class libraries are included. Those libraries can be used by just making an instance from those class.  
Those libraries have common methods to get/set device information.

### 2.2.1 Constructors
`PCA9955B`, `PCA9956B` and `PCA9957` are classes to make instances. To make those instance, one option can be specified.   

```cpp
// defining 3 LED driver instances ('ledd_1' is having option to set non-default I²C target address)
#include <PCA9955B.h>
#include <PCA9956B.h>
#include <PCA9957.h>
PCA9955B ledd_0;         // making instance of  PCA9955B as 'ledd_0' with default I2C addess (0xBE)
PCA9956B ledd_1( 0xB0 ); // making instance of  PCA9956B as 'ledd_1' with I2C addess (0xB0)
PCA9957  ledd_2;         // making instance of  PCA9957  as 'ledd_2'. No I2C address given because its a SPI device
```

With those instance declaration above, for I²C devices, the `Wire` instance is used as default for I²C bus access.  
If user need to access other TwoWire instance like `Wire1` on Arduino Due, it can be done as below.  
When using non-`Wire` instance, don't forget to change the `Wire.begin()` call. For instance, if you are using `Wire1` it need to be `Wire1.begin()`. 

```cpp
PCA9955B ledd_0( Wire1 );       // making instance of  PCA9955B as 'ledd_0' with default I2C addess (0xBE) on Wire1
PCA9956B ledd_1( Wire1, 0xB0 ); // making instance of  PCA9956B as 'ledd_1' with I2C addess (0xB0) on Wire1
```

### 2.2.2 Basic methods

`begin()` and `pwm()` are basic methods of LEDDriver.  
Method|Role
---|---
`begin( float current = 0.1, board env = NONE )`	|Initializing device. 1st argument `current` is ratio of output current. 0.0~1.0. 2nd argument `env` is an option: use `LEDDriver::ARDUINO_SHIELD` if the target board is Arduino-shield board
`pwm( uint8_t ch, float value )`					|Set single channel LED brightness. `value` must be in float: 0.0~1.0
`pwm( float* values )`								|Set LED brightness for all channels. `values` must be an array of float with length of number of device output channels. Each float values in the array should be 0.0~1.0.
write_r8( uint8_t reg, uint8_t val )				|Direct register write
read_r8( uint8_t reg );								|Direct register read
reg_w( uint8_t reg, uint8_t *vp, int len )			|Direct register sequencial write
reg_r( uint8_t reg, uint8_t *vp, int len )			|Direct register sequencial read

#### 2.2.2.1 `begin()`
`begin()` mathod can take two parameters: `current` and `env`. These parameters are option. If those are not give, default values are applied (0.1 and NONE). 
As described in **warning** of beggining of this document, the first parameter sets current output. 
It can be as range of 0.0 ~ 1.0 which means 0% ~ 100%. 

The second parameter is to set board setting for _**LED Driver Arduino® Shield Evaluation Boards**_. 
Those boards need to have specific pin setting on D8 and D9 pins. When the Shield board using constant of `ARDUINO_SHIELD`. 

```cpp
// Calling 'begin()' method with/without options
ledd_0.begin( 1.0 ); //	'ledd_0' is set to 100% current output. Target is non-Arduino-Shield board
ledd_1.begin();      //	Use default setting. Output current is 10% and target is non-Arduino-Shield board
ledd_2.begin( 0.5, PCA9955B::ARDUINO_SHIELD ); // Output is 50% and target is non-Arduino-Shield board
```
#### 2.2.2.2 `pwm()`
`pwm()` is a method for setting PWM output ratio.  

If the `pwm()` is called with two parameters of `ch` and `value`, it will set the PWM ratio given as `value`. 
The `value` is a float, which needs to be in range of 0.0 ~ 1.0. 

If the `pwm()` is called with a pointer to float array, it will set all PWM channels with values in the array.  
The array size need to be same as the number of LED driver output channels. 

```cpp
// Callong 'pwm()' method with channel number and PWM ratio
ledd_0.pwm( 5, 0.5 );	//	The ledd_0's channel 5 PWM ratio is set to 50%. 
```

```cpp
// Callong 'pwm()' method with an array of float
float v[ ledd_0.n_chanel ] = { 0.2 }; // Prepare an array of float, initialized to all 0.2. 'n_chanel' is available to get the LED driver output chanels
v[ 7 ] = 0.5;    // Set 0.5 into 7 item in the array
ledd_0.pwm( v );  // All channels are set to 20% ouptput except channel 7 (50%)
```

#### 2.2.2.3 Direct register access
LED driver registers can be accessed by methods of `write_r8`, `read_r8`, `reg_w` and `reg_r`.  
`write_r8` and `read_r8` are single 8bit register write/read access methods.  
`write_r8` takes register index and 8 bit value. `read_r8` takes register index and returns 8bit value. 

`reg_w` and `reg_r` provides sequencial access of registers. For PCA9955B and PCA9956B, set auto-increment bit in register index. 

### 2.2.3 Methods for buffer mode

Method|Role
---|---
`buffer_enable( bool flag )`	|Buffer mode enabling by giving parameter of `true`. Give `false` to disable
`flush( void )`					|Flushing data. The buffer contents will be sent to the LED driver

The **buffer mode** can be used for all LEDDriver instances. 
The buffer mode is to save I²C/SPI bus bandwidth. Without the buffering, the MCU and LED driver interaction happens each time of `pwm()` method call.  
To avoid waste of bandwidth, the buffer mode can be used.  

After the buffer mode enabled, the `pwm()` method call updates PWM value in buffer memory. The brightness of LED is not changed at this moment.  
After all necessary channel values update is done, `flush()` method can be called to update LED driver output. 

```cpp
// Buffer mode usage
ledd_0.buffer_enable( true );              // Buffer mode enabled for ledd_0
for ( int i; i < ledd_0.n_channel; i++) {
	ledd_0.pwm( i, 0.5 );                  // 50% setting for each channels. Settings are stored in buffer memory
}

ledd_0.flush();  // Update LED driver with new values
```

Example code is available for how the buffer mode can be used. Please refer to code in `examples/concept_examples/buffered_mode`

## 2.3 LED class
The `LED` is a tiny class but helps much to manage multiple LEDs.  
Providing a further abstraction layer for each single LED.  

An LED can be an instance, PWM setting can be done by assignment.  
If it is defined in array, those LEDs can be indexed independent from LED drivers. 

To see basic idea for the `LED` class, see `examples/concept_examples/abstracting_LEDs`. 

```cpp
// examples/concept_examples/abstracting_LEDs.ino
#include <PCA9955B.h>
#include <LED.h>

PCA9955B ledd;

LED led[] = {
  LED(&ledd, 0), LED(&ledd, 1), LED(&ledd, 2), LED(&ledd, 3),
  LED(&ledd, 4), LED(&ledd, 5), LED(&ledd, 6), LED(&ledd, 7),
  LED(&ledd, 8), LED(&ledd, 9), LED(&ledd, 10), LED(&ledd, 11),
  LED(&ledd, 12), LED(&ledd, 13), LED(&ledd, 14), LED(&ledd, 15)
};

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("\n***** Hello, PCA9955B! *****");

  Wire.begin();
  ledd.begin(0.1, PCA9955B::ARDUINO_SHIELD);
}

void loop() {
  led[0] = led[3] = led[6] = 1.0;
  led[1] = led[4] = led[7] = 0.0;
  led[2] = led[5] = led[8] = 0.0;
  delay(100);

  led[0] = led[3] = led[6] = 0.0;
  led[1] = led[4] = led[7] = 1.0;
  led[2] = led[5] = led[8] = 0.0;
  delay(100);

  led[0] = led[3] = led[6] = 0.0;
  led[1] = led[4] = led[7] = 0.0;
  led[2] = led[5] = led[8] = 1.0;
  delay(100);
}
```

## 2.4 GradationControl class
The `GradationControl` can be used for PCA9955B and PCA9957. Those LED devices support the gradation control feature. 
The PCA9955B can control 4 groups of gradation control and the PCA9957 can control 6 groups.  

The `GradationControl` class makes a group of the gradation control.  
Once the instance is made, assign channels and set its blink behavior. Don't forget set PWM output for the channels before start. 
Because the gradation control operates the LED by current. So if the PWM output is 0%, LED will not truned ON.  

```cpp
#include <PCA9955B.h>
#include <GradationControl.h>

PCA9955B ledd;

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();
  ledd.begin(1.0, PCA9955B::ARDUINO_SHIELD);

  GradationControl group = GradationControl(&ledd, 0); //  Gradation group 0
  group.add_channel(7);   //  Assign channel 7 to group 0
  ledd.pwm(7, 1.0);       //  Set PWM output

  group.set_gradation(1.0, 1.0);  //  Set peak current to 100% and ramp-time to 1.0 second
  group.start();                  //  Start group 0
}

void loop() {
  //  do nothing from MCU
}
```
